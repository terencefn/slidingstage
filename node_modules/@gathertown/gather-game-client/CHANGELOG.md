# preamble

This is a sorry attempt at a changelog.
Things change all the time, and it would be pretty hard to document all of it.
But, at least for breaking changes between versions, we'll do our best.

# breaking-change-log

## 38.0.0

### breaking changes

- loosened the TS type on game.engine, so now TS thinks it can be undefined. It hasn't actually gotten undefined in more cases, we just removed a spooky cast. Recommend switching to game.sendAction instead if you've been accessing it directly (which eliminated the second argument, btw)
- spaces (private spaces) deprecated in favor of nooks (new)
- desks (experimental) deprecated in favor of nooks
- renamed map type from GameMapV2 to GameMap
- changed client-side type of map.collisions from boolean[][] to { [y: number]: { [x: number]: true } } -- for memory efficiency
- possibly more, it's been a while

## other changes

## 35.0.0

### breaking changes

- game.chat now expects the fourth argument to come in as an object, (`{ content: "my message" }`) rather than the string itself (e.g. `"my message"`)
